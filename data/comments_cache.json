It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.  Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction’s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).  Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player’s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are “encounter” cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness."

          "text": "[b][FirstImpression20thNov2013][/b]Where do I even start. As a Mac Gerdts fan, this feels similar (in a good way; his signature designs are in there), yet different. The 'rondel' is now the cards that you recycle in your hand.  There are five different resources in the game, but I don't know which one to focus on while in the game. Everything seems important but not all are easy to achieve. Cloth/silk is important to buy cards, brick is important for foundation to build building, tools and wheat/food are important to bring in new colonies. Every resources is important but I don't think focusing on all is a good idea.   Cards that you purchase will shape how you will score at the end of the game, so basically you also want to focus in what your cards will score for you.   For those who are familiar with Mac Gerdts designs, you will see some similarities to his other designs (note this doesn't mean a bad thing at all). The 'rondel' mechanic is still there, but there are now switched to cards instead of the actual rondel. The 'no points are scored' while the game is in progress is there, so basically only when the game ends we will score for VPs. The ship and person wooden tokens are in similar shape as his previous games.    I like that he didn't use cubes to represent the materials, so you can recognize the resources right from their shape.   So far I have to say I like it although I still need more play just to see how much I like it.  [b][SecondPlayOn21stNov2013][/b]Played a 2 player game. I can confirm that it works although the dynamic has now changed. With 2 players, you can focus more in certain areas, but not in multiplayer games.  In our 2 player game, my opponent ended the game by buying the last 2 cards, and with my last and final turn, I built up all my 15 buildings (which is the other end game condition).   The game ends in about an hour."

Every turn is a nice little puzzle based on the pieces you draw, the special actions you manage to aquire and the strategy you try to pursue.  :star: Not so hard to teach. This is a rather straight forward game that should be easy to teach to people that have played a deck builder before. :star: The events spice things up a little. In the game I played, the tax events appeared rather late and so the hoarding of resources was expensive. This might be another thing to keep in mind in the next game. :star: I`m not so sure if there are really multiple routes to victory or if this is more of a race where everyone is aiming for the same things and you`re just trying to get the best scoring tiles first. Either way, currently I'm okay with it either way. :star: Our first game was quite long. It might be that we're slow players, but we weren't even close to 90 minutes."

Each guest has its own special ability which takes effect when they occupy a room, If you do it right, one guest allows you to do X which allows for Y which allows you to take care of another guest which does Z. That's the trend now, and I don't like it. It can cause a single turn to be insanely long,  It would have been a pretty good medium weight without it.

I supose that this rate could improve but I have to test it with fewer players. Maybe 3 players.  edit: Played with 3 players and again with four. This time the pace of the game was much more interesting because players were familiar to the game. It improved a lot. I now know that I prefer this game with 4 players because although we have less actions than with 3, the truth is that the demanding for food is much more balanced allowing players to do different things.   I still think the game is a bit too repetitive and long but it improved a lot. By now I really think I like to play it and that I should do so more often.  After a few more plays, I really like Le Havre. At first I didn't get it but after playing it with more care I realized that this is a very good game with lots of difficult things to combine as decisions to make: what building to build, when to build or buy, how to get food... always different decisions because the way buildings are organized makes each game a unique game and so does the way players play the game.  More aggressive play happens after players know the game better and best buildings are known. Being the butcher seems to work pretty fine and learning the exact timing of when to take a supply turn or an action turn is a key issue to success.  I like to play it as a 2 player game too. Maybe it's how it works better because it doesn't have any down time and the number of actions per turn is much more interesting in order to make things workable as a small economy.  (G)"

However, the interesting gameplay and the miriads of choices will make up for that. We were overwhelmed in the first two turns as to what we can and should do, but towards the end of the game the pieces kind of came together. After coming home I read the rules again, and I feel we could teach it to friends or to the kids, but Troyes is a kind of game that is hard to teach well, and it helps if you know the action cards well when teaching the game.

None of us concentrated adequately on building out our estates early and we were all pretty starved for money and actions as a result, especially when on turn 5, with bad weather, only one of us could produce more than one wine (and yes, that player won). I don't think it is fair to judge this based on a poorly played learning game. Overall, I thought the mechanisms were interesting but I agree with the critics who say that the game lacks opacity. Paths to development and points are all very clear once you grok the mechanics and there is minimal change from players bumping into each other. Yes, players can claim spots ahead of others, but there are usually decent 2nd options available in most cases. I could see games quickly falling into familiar patterns, which could make it less interesting. I do want to play this version again now that I have a better understanding of the arc, but ultimately I think I'll need to like the 2016 Reserve a bit more than the 2010 for me to keep this game longer term. It will be interesting to see differences, for sure."

We all had 33 actions. In the four player game this will be 25 unless I missed something. Scores were high but not so far apart. I had 234, 208 and 203. My tableau building won me the game.  I had a 68 point difference with the player who scored the second highest. There are a ton of points to be made in resource conversion into VP . I only scored 16 points there. The best was 54 but there was one building were the sum of the resources was 40 after conversion.  To round of my thoughts this is an excellent game in the genre but if you own a few you probably own enough."

I probably played about 20 times during the first week I got it, mainly with two-players.   It's an engine-building game in a way, where cards that you have played (they remain in front of you), will provide discounts for your future purchases.   I played it with three once, and didn't like the downtime, although it's not long at all. Probably I'm so used to the speed in a two-player game.  After plenty of two-player games, I can see that the winning strategy lies on grabbing the noble cards. Getting 2/3 of the nobles bags you six points already, and that's a big deal. Getting all nobles then becomes a huge deal. One thing I didn't like much is how third tier cards are less claimed. Maybe not in a multi-player game.  Anyway, I was proved wrong one time, when my opponent (two-player game) won the game without any nobles, while I had three nobles.   ==== Update. Mom requested this.

I returned it, and Amazon sent a second one which had a good game box (I thought), but they still did not properly pack the inside of the shipping box. When I opened the Nations game to do inventory, one side of the insert was busted. I blame this on the extra big box with a lot of empty space inside it, and the heavy components laying against the insert. However upon further inspection on the external side of that Nations box, it was apparent this game had been mishandled before it ever was put in the shipping container. There was an impact area along the edge of the game box where it had either been improperly stacked, or dropped or something (but the shipping container was in perfect shape externally). I returned this second Nations game to Amazon and canceled my order completely. I received full refund 28AUG2015. The game was purchased from \"Newbend Discount\". So there you go, I spent a good portion of August attempting to get a good copy of the game. Maybe it just wan't meant to be. I pre-ordered \"The Gallerist\" from a local game store instead.

The auction mechanism is pretty good like in Amun Re or Vegas Showdown but that's all because once you're done with the auction everything else can be pure chaos because of, especially, the cards. Cards can ruin 3 or 4 turns in a single action.  But my major complaint goes for two strong reasons: first of all the fact that the player who has the most money has the advantage to get even more money - the possibilities of a player to recover are poor. Even if a player can recover from a serious defeat the game is not very fun anymore because it takes too much time for that player to get back into the game. The second reason has to do with the bash the leader feeling. It's obvious that once all players know that someone goes ahead in the game, that player has to be controlled by other's actions. This is something I don't like in games.  I can give it another try but I'm not sure I'll change my opinion about it.  (T)"

All the choices are there, the production is very good and the time of play is excellent. A good choice for train games.  If Raylroad Tycoon is too much simple and easy to play, Age of Steam too much cruel and hard to manage, Steam is the perfect meeting between both and my favorite train game at this point. I think Martin Wallace really got it right with Steam! Superb game.  Some rules changes made Steam better than Age of Steam IMO. I like the fact that city growing is not a random move that could makes things easier to lucky players. I prefer the kind of game that allows players to chose what they want.  The other rule change I like is the fact that players can't now transport a goods cube that it's not favorable to him, meaning that negative game play is no longer possible by principle.   The third major change has to do with income and expenses. They both are easier to manage and make the game more friendly.  After a few more plays with only 3 players I'm starting to get a bit tired of the original map and I'm starting to think about new expansions, especially to play with 2/3 players, which is the range I get more often. I understand that this game should be played with more players - minimum four - but I can't gather enough people for that very often so I guess I'll have to go for the small maps expansions. One of the things that are starting to bug me in Steam is the lack of surprise in the final scoring. I usually lose my games for a couple of points but it's really something I can see a few turns from ending and, in the last couple of games, I couldn't revert the situation. I'm not sure if this means that a good early start makes a too strong position or if it's just a coincidence...  (N)"

This is a top game, a gamers terrific experience. Although 2030 is based on old Imperial with only but a few minor changes, it turns out to be a significantly different game. Both the map and the scoring mechanism are different enough to absorb players into a different game play despite its resemblances to original Imperial. This version is much more confrontational, controlling nations it's not as secure as in original Imperial. Tweaks and power changes are constant. Still best game ever made along with old/original Imperial."

My first play left me lost and confused ALL the time (Note that the person who taught me the game did a good job in teaching the game, it was me who didn't grab the rule very well).  Very simple game but steep learning curve (to learn when someone teaches it to you, also it's a difficult game to teach and let people understand) I'd say. Once you wrap your head around the 3 basic actions you can do, everything will go real easy and smooth from that point on.   I like the city building aspect, where you're trying to build, improve and take over districts. As the game progresses, your basic actions improved (this is done when you do building action) and become better. I like how the starting 3x3 grid of the city grows throughout the play, you get that nice 3D spatial element near game end.  I can see myself becoming better over repeated plays.

Still, the strength of the role-selection mechanism and the tactical choices offered by discarding some cards to \"build\" (play) others made for a fun game.

But the game flow happened to be straight forward and the time of play can easily be reduced to 90 minutes, I guess.  The small parts combined give players the feeling that everything is connected and the way VP's are gathered come in a reasonable number of different sources.  The amount of men each player has to play with it's important and here is where I feel the game could give more equal chances to each player. Getting your men back from the courthouse it's not an easy task and often happened in our experience that only one bonus or personality card was available in the turn making this action the most valuable one for an important part of the game. That's mostly a drawing issue as in our next game I guess the way cards are randomly taken can make this action much less valuable if the  number of cards appear in a more balanced way but, nevertheless it felt a bit annoying.  Certainly a good game to watch for and play a lot more times in order to get into it and appreciate it in a much more honest way."

I am not cut out for the negotiation aspect of it, and ended up blowing the game by letting myself be talked in and out of things, which must be fatal every game. I had a great time- loved the tension between cooperation and competition. But the next day, I have a nagging feeling that it won't be the same feeling if we play again- like when you like a dish so much so you make it again the next day, or when, as a kid, a pick-up baseball or football game is so much fun and you all agree to play again the next day. That next day is always a let-down, and feels forced. Is that how a 2nd game of this would go? I am not really sure how to rate this. It was an OK game, but a great experience. Would I play it again?

It's clear that designer is very detail oriented as can be seen from double sided board, card panoramas, and etc. Game changers are nice that they make each game session different, especially when playing with different groups of people.  Cons: Card effects have such a high variance that it's okay to play this game casually, but hard to play competitively. Some city event cards demolish upgrades, or close particular types of rides, and it's impossible to play around. Some cards let you roll two D6 and earn that much money based on what you rolled, so if you are lucky you get as much as 12 coins, or not so lucky you get as little as 2 coins. Some cards let you build an upgrade from your hand for free. In the early game this is huge if you draw the right combination of cards as it's a huge income boost and you start off way ahead. There are tons of cards like these which are more luck based than skill based. The fun part of the game is really building rides and customize them with upgrades, yet it's very difficult to get money. If you are not lucky enough to draw events and/or low cost rides to boost income in the early game, you have very little chance to compete with other players. Also some cards can be nasty when messing with other players. Yes the game is called unfair, but unfair events are really no fun.  All in all, it's a good game, but not good enough to justify occupying a shelf space, thus sold my copy."

This is \"solved\" by allowing players to give up a turn to banish an enemy to the bottom of the deck, but this creates a dilemma - who's going to give up their own turn to benefit the other players, who will get first crack at the new enemy?  Also, the \"basic\" set suggested in the rules is simply wrong. It includes guys who should never be purchased as they are less useful than the others.  Otherwise, I like the overall transition from building an engine that enables purchasing to building an engine that slays monsters. It's unclear to me how much to value cards that do both decently."

Homesteaders is an economic, resource management game, with an auction element and a variety of buildings that players can construct to provide income, resource production, points, trading power, and various special powers.    It combines building resource costs with an auction/monetary element in a unique way.  The construction of a building requires both the collection of the appropriate resources through trade or production, and the winning of an auction for the appropriate type of land for that building type.   Players need to develop both resource production of important materials such as Steel and Copper, to be able to build buildings, and monetary income, to be able to win auctions.  The game contains a variety of strategic paths to victory, and should appeal greatly to lovers of economic development games!  Homesteaders plays in 60/75 minutes for a 3/4 player game with experienced players.  Add 15-30 minutes for newer players."

I think Martin Wallace achieved something he wanted to achieve which is designing two similar games based on the same subject but for different audiences and giving players distinct feelings.  I like Brass better. At this point I don't even compare both since I've only played the German map which seems to be the most uninteresting one. I have to play in the US map to grasp the real feeling of the game. Plus, unlike Brass, Age of Industry seems to work a lot better with more players (4/5).  Played again with two players. It's not a perfect game with two players giving some placement dispute problems and also some extra needless turns but still a good experience. I would definitely rate it a 7 with two players which is not a bad rate. I like the tactic timing aspects of the game when playing with two which seem more obvious because there is no chaos element with this format. A good option.   After playing it with four players, the German map, I really can't rate it isolated from its history/existence. This game was released after Brass and I can't rate it based in innovation, mechanics or anything alike. The most important stuff I see about Age of Industry is its resemblances and differences from Brass and at this point I have to say that I like Brass so much more. First of all this game doesn't solve the time of play \"issue\". From all the games I've played so far I can't tell that they last shorter than Brass although it doesn't have two periods. Secondly and despite Martin Wallace talked about how he likes this loan option better, I don't. I find it boring and not strategic enough like it is in Brass. One of the key aspects of this game is still the timing of play and the way players can control or not they're positioning in the turn order but I for some reason have the idea that in Brass advantages are more obvious. I still haven't explored the US map enough (the same with the German map really) and I fell that it's something I have to do before taking my final rating decision.  The main difference between Brass and Age of Industry in my opinion is the one single industry per city. I find this rules very annoying and much more card dependent in some sense.   After playing the game one more time I down rated it to 7. I like the game obviously and I'll play it more of course but I find it long, a bit boring by the end and a bit static maybe because there are not many building options.  Plus, this game doesn't have anything new. It doesn't have any special new mechanic that I particularly appreciate. But I would recommend it to gamers in a second for sure.  UPDATE With 2 players I have to rate it a 6. It didn't grab me enough. A lot of other games come first when playing with 2 players only. This means that a new 2 player map is needed Martin!  (N)"

It brings our everyone's poker faces but the fun factor is through the roof. I was introduced to this game at the Tokyo Game's Market 2013, and the crowd that gathered around the table confirmed that it was not only me that was intrigued by the game play. The theme is just the icing on the cake, even though \"Men\" are not the only ones I've seen enjoy this Dungeon of Mandom.   It's been a huge hit during breaks at work, with coworkers almost daily coming to request a match. Even after introducing several other great fillers that they have all enjoyed, the requests keep coming for more Mandom. I'm guaranteed a good time even when breaking it out at a restaurant with the boyfriend. Get it if you can!  [b]Pros:[/b]  - Easy to pull out and play at work everyday.  - Games are variable with different strategies ridden to victory, or one's own doom, every time. - In micro-game fashion, games are very quick. - Every time you flip a card there are cheers and surprises abound. - It has a very small footprint - More people increases the bluffing factor and intrigue. 2 player is much more tactical. - 2 player is a great \"waiting for your food\" filler at a restaurant.   [b]Cons:[/b]  - It is what it is. Short and sweet. A great filler and a surprising amount of meat on a tiny bone. - Can't play it on the train. haha   [b]2014 Rating:[/b] 9.05 [b]Plays:[/b] 34 [b]2013 Rating:[/b] 9.05 [b]Plays:[/b] 5"

It's all about min-maxing with only partial information, as other players keep adding hidden monsters of various strength to the dungeon pile. Only the last player who hasn't passed gets to explore and potentially win the treasure. Hinges on knowing/guessing if the others want to pass because the dungeon is too tough, or if they want to stay in it, because they believe they can explore the dungeon safely.  With 4 players, game length can be way longer than the box suggests. Each player can lose 2 times minus 1 for the ultimate winner. That's at least 7 rounds. If each player also wins once, that's another 3 rounds. That's 10 rounds of play in the worst case. Due to player elimination, this can make the game drag."

Mainly though this game is disappointing because it does not feel all that innovative. Its weird though, I guess i could just say that about Splendor, I mean it did nothing particularly new, it just did it so well. Perhaps that will be this designers mark, doing things well but not breaking the mold.   Still the other thing I really like about Marc Andre's games is the balance between simpleness and depth.  Here is another prime example."

Et bien Barony, c'est un peu pareil, mais sans la partie géopolitique et les dragons. Ici, on essaye juste de s'étaler sur le plateau de jeu avec ses châteaux, ses chevaliers, ses villages, mais surtout d'en déloger les autres, par la force, évidemment. Avec un objectif, prendre les trône des 7 couronnes. Barony est un sympathique jeu de placement et d'opportunité, avec des règles simples, des parties de moins d'une heure.

Throw dice, look at what you can do (sometimes nothing, sometimes a lot, sometimes something in between), destroy a card or building of your opponent, done. You have to be a bit skillful in how you manage the result of the dice, but in the end, the flow of the game is completely determined by them—and I hate that. Therefore this game is not a member of the Dice Done Right Club™. You can think of a perfect way to combat forums, merchants or centurios, but if the dice don't let you, tough luck. Oops, just got the crucial card in my plan destroyed by a lucky opponent. The game should appeal to people who like games where luck determines your course of action; otherwise, avoid. Eventually sold off, without a single shred of regret.  [b]Update[/b] After many years I revisited the rules of this game, and came to the conclusion that the above might in fact be a big bunch of baloney, written by a very green n00b. I've removed the rating for this game on the grounds of suspecting it [i]way[/i] too harsh; I'm also rescheduling another visit to ancient Rome.

I'm not sure how much of that total play time is the result of having players unfamiliar with the game, and how much is just the time that Patchistory takes to play. My hope is that when it hits the table again, having everyone familiar with the game will cut down on the time considerably.  Because there's a lot to like here... It's a nice build up from your simple civilization to your end-of-game empire. There are a variety of options to score you points - do you pursue military dominance, or focus on the production of culture, or enlist the special functions of historical personalities and world wonders, or optimize your civic actions and plan for a wealth of votes at the end of the era. Each offers its own strengths and weaknesses and presents different strategies to mix and maximize.   Some great things going on in this game; I just hope it takes a little less time to explore them next time.  "

I have some doubts about how to control your strategy when playing with 4 or 5 players.  Components are generaly above the average although I don't like the art on the board very much. It's not a very cruel game to players in general, because resources are available for everybody at some point. Of course that since I've only played it with 3 players maybe choices were easier because of the strong offer.  The civilisation feeling it's not that strong, at least for me. I found the theme very well implemented but didn't get the civ feeling. Maybe it's my fault I admit.  I really have to try this game again.  After playing a few times more, with 2 and 3 players, I still don't have the civ feeling. It's a good game and I have to play it with 4 players.  Played again. First buildings suck. I don't understand why should players buy them because they don't work at all. They cost cubes to keep and give 1 or 2 VP's. Plus, they also cost one action.  Food is an important issue at the end game but not at the beggining. In that sense this game works as a different civ. The secret of te game seems to be in the board and in the number of cubes players can get.  Some discoveries are pointless when comparing to others. Why should players invent something like TV that gives, at most, 6 VP's and costs 5 coins (almost 2 VP's at the end of the game) when they can get Lenine for about 7 to 10 points costing nothing?!  Still struggling with some issues of the game. I don't like to play it with 3 players and I'm afraid that I'm discovering a totally chaotic game, not only with 3 players but also with more. The way pressure arises from every part of the map makes king making a very plausible scenario. Still have to play it with 4 and 5 player to determine how much do I like or not of this game.  (T)"

Scoring is more fun in this game and takes slightly longer than Lost Cities.  Such a table hog but not a problem for us. Interesting way of how a card can be used in one of three different ways. Scoring happens a lot but not difficult to count. It is not mathy unlike Lost Cities.   Scoring is triggered in a countdown method; players try to occupy passengers in the matching tram. Once tram is full, score takes place for the corresponding colour. This is interesting dynamic as players decide to delay the score or not.   Big plus point: my mom enjoys the game.

But it's 2014, and whales are endangered, and abused. Having a game that depicts the blatant destruction of these animals is unnecessary at best and teaching animal cruelty at worst.  I wish the designer and or publisher would reconsider this aspect of the game. Board games don't need to be 100% historically accurate to be fun and engaging and we as human beings need to draw a line in the proverbial sand, when it comes to simulating horrifying things for fun."

Megvan benne az a tipikusan Kniziás érzés. De a csata komoly, az biztos hogy nem beszélhetünk békés egymás mellett építkezésről. A tábla elég hamar beszűkül annyira, hogy egymásba akadjunk.  A light-ság talán csak a lapkahúzás szerencséje miatt van. De egyenlőre még nem tudom, mennyire befolyásolja ez a játékélményt."

Very interactive as in all 2 player games but it doesn't offer too much conflict which is a positive aspect in my opinion as I like positive play more that negative.  UPDATE Played the final version of the game and it really works well! I've played it with Mac Gerdts himself, which is the best possible opponentbI can think about, but even so I think the game has a lot going on and everything is perfectly integrated with the gameplay. A really nice job from Mr. Imperial!  (N)"

          "text": "Mr jack look a like. Zelfde principe, maar nieuw bord, nieuwe personages en nieuw thema. Zou even leuk spelen als mr.Jack. 2  The phantom of the opera is een nieuw epos in de Mr. Jack-reeks en dat mag u héél erg letterlijk nemen. Zowel qua uitzicht, artwork, materiaal als spelverloop vertoont dit spel erg veel overeenkomsten met één van mijn favoriete 2-spelersspellen. Ook de auteurs zijn in deze niet veranderd, dus als u fan bent van Bruno Cathala, Ludovic Maublanc of het spelconcept dat u hier op de blog al enkele keren tegenkwam, dan is dit een erg fijne aanvulling voor uw spellencollectie.    Om u een zicht te geven op het spelverloop raad ik u aan om de recensie van Mr. Jack hier op de blog te lezen. U vindt deze hier: http://www.bloggen.be/speleninlille/archief.php?ID=817135   Naast het thema zijn er toch nog enkele kleine verschillen. Enerzijds loopt het spel op een andere manier op z'n eind en zijn de overwinningscondities ietwat aangepast, je kan bovendien ook een soort van handicap instellen voor diegene die met het fantoom speelt. En de eigenschappen van de karakters zijn ook ietwat anders, hoewel ze erg veel gelijkenissen vertonen met de basisversie van Mr. Jack.   Doel van het spel : ofwel speelt u de inspecteur die tracht het fantoom te vinden vooraleer de diva krankzinnig wordt van dat spook dat constant op haar hielen zit ofwel neemt u de rol aan van het fantoom en tracht u diezelfde rondborstige dame dus de stuipen op het lijf te jagen.  Moeilijkheidsgraad handicap : de speler die met het fantoom speelt kan het zichzelf moeilijker of makkelijker maken. Geen acht vaste ronden meer maar een spoor dat toont hoe gek het fantoom de diva aan het maken is. Indien je het jezelf graag moeilijker maakt begint het fantoom verder op het spoor, indien je het makkelijker wil maken, ga je al enkele stapjes dichter bij het einde van het spoor staan bij aanvang van het spel.  De actiefase : deze blijft identiek aan het vertrouwde Mr. Jack-systeem, in de ene beurt speelt de inspecteur één actie, dan twee keer het fantoom en dan terug de inspecteur, in de volgende beurt is het net omgekeerd. Ook nu weer zijn er acht personages in het spel die alternerend aan de beurt zullen komen om ze te verzetten en hun speciale actie te laten uitvoeren. Licht en donker : op het einde van een ronde moet het fantoom ook weer aangeven of hij zichtbaar is of niet (in dit spel noemt het \"zich openbaren\"). Als hij alleen staat in een kamer of in een kamer die niet verlicht is, openbaart hij zich en wordt de diva een aantal stappen voorwaarts gezet op het spoor. Als er na een beurt nog meer dan twee verdachten overblijven verschuift ze een aantal stappen op het spoor gelijk aan het aantal overblijvende verdachten. Bovendien doet ze één stapje extra als het fantoom zich heeft geopenbaard.  Verplaatsen : geen drie stapjes hier, gewoon naar aangrenzende kamers (indien deze niet op slot is), je mag het aantal stappen zetten gelijk aan het aantal personen aanwezig in de kamer van waaruit je vertrekt.   Als de diva het einde van het spoor bereikt, is het spel afgelopen want loopt ze in een razende vaart uit de opera en wordt de voorstelling geannuleerd. Indien er slechts één verdachte overblijft tijdens het spel, dan wint de inspecteur, is het fantoom ontmaskerd en gaat de diva met een gerust gemoed haar keel open zetten.   De karakters :  - Raoul De Chagny : verplaatsing EN trekt een kaart van de alibistapel (indien fantoomkaart, diva verplaatst één plaats afhankelijk of de rol gekozen worden door het fantoom of door de inspecteur) - Meg Giry : kan tijdens het verplaatsen gebruik maken van geheime gangen - Madame Giry : doet een deur op slot van haar kamer na haar beweging - Joseph Buquet : verplaatst en legt een verduisteringsfiche in z'n kamer - Christine Daaé : verplaatst en mag daarna alle personen in aangrenzende kamers naar haar lokken - M. Moncharmin : verplaatst en laat alle personen in z'n kamer naar aangrenzende kamers vluchten - M. Richard : kan gewoon verplaatsen of volledig met een andere persoon wisselen - De perziër : mag één persoon vanuit z'n beginkamer meenemen tijdens z'n verplaatsing, hij kan deze onderweg achterlaten of meenemen tot in zijn kamer   Titel : The phantom of the opera Auteurs : Bruno Cathala & Ludovic Maublanc Uitgeverij : Hurrican Aantal spelers : 2 Speelduur : 30 min.

To make it worse, you cannot just buy what you want, all purchases are done by auction. When it's your turn, you ask to purchase the item your in need of, then everyone gets to bid on it. You must manage the factories, and if you cannot support the human popluation, you need to consider robots to do the dirty work. Robots help in getting income from the factories, yet do not contribute to the victory points needed to win. The first person to reach 75 victory points is declared the winner and is chosen by the Terrain Confederation to manage the overall planetary development.  Expected playing time is about 2.5 - 3 hours."

What we have is the typical Knizia mechanics (a little Taj, a little Ivanhoe, a little Ra, a little Modern Art lots of LotR) rehashed into a passable, playable game that feels like a mathematical exercise- not slaying Grendel.  Oh yeah, Beowulf slays Grendel, the players just get to tag along and play through auctions and rounds of bluffing or bidding.

A player’s turn is also called a day and is split into 3 phases:  morning, midday, and evening.  For each of these phases, players can perform 1 action.  The morning actions are for collecting materia, the midday are for storing materia on the familiars, and the evening is when you can learn spells.  Once spells are learned, there will also be the option to cast that spell during the spell’s associated phase.  The game ends when any player learns their 7th spell or fills their familiar board.  There are 7 “colors” of spells and the box contains 3 different options for each color which provides variety and different combinations for each game.  It would probably be easy to add even more with an expansion.  I didn’t get much from the theme.  It doesn’t really feel like you’re casting spells.  The game is easy / fast to learn. It seems to be all about managing the materia efficiently, but since drawing 2 is the best way to get the materia you need - that randomness makes it also about luck - maybe more about luck.    The solo game involves using the back of a familiar board to track the AI opponent’s points.  1 materia is added to this board at the end of each day.  In addition to the normal 2 end game conditions, the game can also end if the last space of the AI board is filled.  You can up the difficulty by starting the AI with materia on their board.  All you have to do to manage the AI in the solo, is choose the materia to add to its board, but I didn’t really enjoy it."

I appreciate the bonus contracts at set points along the loyalty track rewarding advancement. I love that completed contracts provide an added action or scoring benefit instead of just earning points--more games should do this. The action spaces are creative and have unique functions and interactions with goods, other action spaces and worker pawns. If you don't like AP games you will not want this game because each turn presents a ton of options to consider that shift with other player choices.  This game rewards smart moves with big bonuses and and punishes stupid!  It will take several plays to see the moves.  This looks like a winner."

Plus, the game might not even be that good, so Queen's crappy Kickstarter may have saved me from getting the game at all.  The last straw was when they opened up a ton more early bird pledges so that every backer could get one. I don't know why they didn't just make the early bird price the price from the beginning, other than greed. To me this demonstrates that they can afford to sell the game for that early bird price, but they were hoping to take advantage of people who were willing to pay more.  Some of the other Queen Kickstarters have been good deals and have added in extras as they gained more pledges, but this one is a cheap cash-grab from an established company who should have just published the game outright.  Update: Now that the game is out, it looks like it's just mediocre at best and it has been discounted multiple times at various online retailers, so I dodged a bullet there."

First they promise shaped ingredients but after the campaign is finished inform backers this is no longer possible.  Secondly, the artwork on the ingredient disks is poor and the pale colors seeped into the white disk background to make a mess of the disks.  Thankfully, designer Tim Fowers provided stickers to cover up those ugly images.  Game Salute also blamed a long delay on perfecting a timer after announcing the game as print ready during the campaign.  In short, Game Salute lied numerous times during this campaign and the likelihood of supporting another GS kickstarter is slim to none (with the possible exception of Keyflower expansions since I have very little options there and they have yet to mess up straight up distribution partnerships to my knowledge).

Els llocs et donen recursos, diners, ordre de torn, comprar parceles de la ciutat (tipus Carson), construir edificis, etc... Quan construeixes un edifici col·loques un cub del teu color sobre ell en un dels dos llocs disponibles (cada lloc et dona un benefici diferent, després es pot canviar fent una acció determinada). - Fase d'ingresos: cobres recursos/diners/PVs en funció dels edificis i losetes que tinguis.  Una mica decepció, esperava alguna cosa més. El mercat pot tindre la seva gracia per la forma en que es reparteixen les losetes, però és una part molt petita del joc. Els edificis surten en ordre en funció del torn, de manera que el joc es pot fer repetitiu. La interacció és molt limitada, cada jugador es pot fer el seu \"barri\" i evitar trobarse amb els demés...

High and low value spirit cards can be useful. Powerful spirits win conflicts and lesser spirits get first dibs on water or abilities. The spirit card draft leads to a \"12 Days of Christmas\" style of resolving spirit effects that remain in play.  This leads to an interesting timing strategy with early played spirits resolving more often (this might bog down play in later rounds?). I also enjoy the rain system and the irrigation walls used to control the precious rain water for controlled flooding of the paddies, mismanaging your water spills to your neighbor--wonderful.  Finally, I love how the game incorporates the synergy of nature such as ducks controlling pests and providing fertilizer, and oxen clearing obstacles in the field to start new paddies. By the end of play, you will be surprised to learn how much labor and how many processes are involved in growing yummy rice."

It may be too early to say it - but I think this one's absolutely in that golden zone of games that get played a lot.

Interactively compete to wipe out or populate these planets with new species as the solar system evolves and expands. The distinctive characteristics of the game are the jagged edged round tiles representing planets that can stack on multi-use goal tokens to create a rule-breaking benefit. I also like the shared nature of the communal solar system as players try to outmaneuver each other. Picking up the personal goal tiles as you play one of your drafted planets is a great variation to the mundane common method of drawing from a stack. Push your luck aspect deciding whether to go full out and deplete all your resources in a single turn big move or to hold back for more surgical strikes."

If Knizia is Bach (with his repeating themes and almost programmatic approach to game design), Dorra is Beethoven: the opposite of programmatic, but simple and powerful and utterly coherent.   This looks to be yet another fine example of his M.O.     "

Included in this is a movement card that also affects turn order for the next push-your-luck card draw.  When you take a card you put it in one of 5 positions.  After everyone has 5 cards, everyone delivers in the order that was chosen above.  This is all multi-player solitaire.  Deliveries get you either cash or track advancements.  Then, whoever is in 1st (2nd/3rd) place on each of the tracks get VPs.  Rinse and repeat.  Myeh.  Looks fun to play but I don't see why I'd need to own it."

          "text": "Gigamon MFG: Blue Orange Games #of Players: 2 -4 Age Range: 6+ Overall Construction:  In Gigamons you will receive 4 cheat cards that are made of a material similar to standard playing cards. The Elemons & the Gigamons are made of the same quality cardboard as what you would find in Memory. They are a nice durable batch of cards. There are little plastic bases that are pretty standard, they go on the bottoms of the Gigamons. The rules are in a nice glossy rulebook, unlike most of the parts, it needs to be handled gently. There are also plastic bags to put your cheat cards, rocks, and bases in, but they are not necessary. Now for the negative. The only negative I have found about the game is the difficulty of opening the box. With that being said, the box will not randomly come open. Bet you thought I was going to forget to mention the box didn’t you. Gameplay: The one thing I like most about Blue Orange Games is the simplicity of their gameplay. This game is no different. If you know how to play Memory, then you already know half of the rules.  Each player is given a cheat card. It details all of the special abilities of the Elemons. The Elemons are shuffled and dealt out into a 3x3 field. The youngest player starts off by flipping over 2 cards. If there is a match take the pair, check the cheat card for the special abilities of the cards, and perform the special ability if possible. If you have 2 different Elemons, but one is the Polymon then you take both of them. If neither of them is the Polymon, then flip them back over. Play continues around the table. Once a player collects 3 of any Elemon they ca trade them in for the matching Gigamon.  Everyone is trying to collect 3 Gigamons to win the game. This can be harder than you’d think since other players can steal your Gigamon from you if they collect 3 of the same Elemons. Yes/No Recommend:  Unlike your standard game of Memory, Gigamon feels like it gives you a goal to shoot for. There are several mechanics to this game that make it more fun than memory and a better starter game to teach children matching. The reason it makes a better game to use with children to teach matching is because it also teaches two other important skills, strategy & reading. I say reading because I make players read the cheat card to use their Elemon’s special ability when a match is made. Strategy because of the timing in which you capture Gigamons and use how you use the special their special abilities. Example: The Flaremon (Fire Element) give you the ability to destroy another players Elemon, which puts them one extra element away from getting a Gigamon. The Geomon (Earth Element) allows you to place rocks that no other player can move. Ave fun exploring all of the ways you can use the special abilities to your advantage. Where To Get It: Currently the best place to get this item is your local game or hobby shop. The big boxes are slowly getting these games, so it will only be a matter of time before you will be able to get them there as well.

Eventually he escapes, boards a smuggling ship, then makes his way to the island, where he manages to recover the fortune. But did he find all of value on the island? That's not what proposed in The Secret of Monte Cristo. \\13\\\\13\\ The players are smugglers who learned of the treasure from Dantès while traveling together, and now each of them has decided to search the island for any treasure that might remain. Each round players receive cards that show what type of treasure (gems) might be found in the castle, with the active player that round placing three smugglers in the castle and all other players placing one. \\13\\\\13\\ Once new treaure has been distributed in the castle rooms, players then take actions based on the order of the marbles showing in the game's \"action slide\" – this being a tilted rack with four slots in it, with a different action associated with each slot. The player whose marble is at the bottom of slot one takes that action, then places the marble at the top of any other slot; then the player at the bottom of slot two takes that action; and so forth. \\13\\\\13\\ Players can seize treasure from rooms if they outnumber the other smugglers present and they have the right sacks on hand for storing the treasure."

One of the problems with the current Z-Man/Rio Grande situation is that it can \"mask\" the original publisher's brand with the Z-Man/RGG brand, which is not good. Heads of State is Eggert-Spiele, a brand I studiously avoid these days as they are really unreliable. But you'd never know that from looking at the box unless you looked quite closely. Had it been clear it was an Eggert game, I never would have bought it. Fortunately more solid brands (Hans im Gluck, Kosmos) tend to have their branding more prominently on their co-productions."

Solved using the variant that everyone has 3 moves, however the animals (which play a larger roll) have too much \"take that\".  Losing a turn is a pain in the butt.  Thought about ways to tweak the game and in the end decided it was better to focus on other games, that are already in a state I enjoy, than fiddle playtesting this one.   Was tough, I wanted to like it and bring it to the table, and it had some sentimental value, however I have limited game shelf space and other games were more interesting to me every time.

In each round, 12 tricks are resolved simultaneously. Each trick is about a particular aspect of countries such as size or populations: either highest or lowest.  When winning a trick, players need to decide whether a card is used for plain score or in a competition of largest continent set for end game bonus.  This game is unlike all other trick taking game.  One doesn’t need to follow tricks and there is no trump suit per se.  Each card already has all categories it need.  This may be the first time I treated a game as trick taking game while BBG doesn’t say so; it’s usually the other way round.  Each card depicts information about a country.  This is educational.  Sadly, the figures may need periodical update to reflect the latest situation.  My copy has the 2020 information."

I will probably regret missing the deluxe version at some point in the future, however at this time I just can't justify the cost for a game I don't know if I would ever get to play.

Probably one of the Essen releases I'm more interested in.  edit: just read the final version of the rules.  Looks to be a pickup/deliver game with some economic to it.  However, what makes it interesting is the deck building aspect.  To \"lay track\" you need to buy cards which give you special powers.  Very interested to see how this one plays."

What I didn't like was the fact that so many of the tiles could only go in certain locations which meant that super combo of 3 tiles next to each other (which doubles your points) doesn't happen hardly at all in the second half of the game. Also, the Gardens tiles seemed wildly overpowered. I had 3 of the 6 of them and won our game by a comfortable margin. My two biggest scoring turns were with the Gardens tiles. Will try 2 player to see if this is worth keeping or a Trade Pile dweller. "
